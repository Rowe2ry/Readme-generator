  ## Description  

  

  A command line application used to manage a database of roles, departments, and employees in a company database.  

  * Motivation  

    To use SQL and node.js together to make managing a complex database easy.  

  * Reason for Building  

    This was mainly an exersize in combining the tools in node and in SQL to allow a user to send and retraive data in a database without needing to know SQL commands or syntax,  

  * Problems Solved  

    It is a streamlined and high performance "no-frills" application to manage a database.  

  * Things Learned  

    This is the project where I not only took my first deep dive into an extensive set of npm documentation, I also finally got promise functionality in JavaScript to a new level of predictability and fundamental understanding. It was also my first time generating, populating, and editing a database with SQL.
