  ## Description  

  

  A video to demonstrate the command line interface of a README generator.  

  * Motivation  

    To show people how easy it is to interface with the command line using node.  

  * Reason for Building  

    Guide developers through the otherwise mundane process of writing a README.  

  * Problems Solved  

    Automtatic README formatting, and guranteed inclusion of all required README elements.  

  * Things Learned  

    This was my first time writing a command line based application. I learned to modularize the JS applications and link them together.
